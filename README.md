3D Reconstruction using Kinect V2 - Computer Vision
===================================================
 
The repository contains elements that were necessary to effectuate the project on 3D Reconstruction using Kinect V2. The project entailed the following tasks: calibration of the cameras, calculating the global rotation and translation matrices and finally performing 3D construction.

The repository contains four subfolders namely, Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3 and Project. Each of these folders have two subfolders namely, Code and Images - except lab 1 - and a report putting it all together.
